# CP(copy) command Implementation
Implementing a cp-like command using c as a practice of system programming. 
## Compiling
First compile the program using [g++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiling-with-g-plus-plus/)
```bash
g++ my-cp.c -o my-cp
```
Then run the program, having two pathes (one you want to copy from, the other one the path you want to copy to), let's say you have a source.txt file and you want to copy it into current directory: 
```bash
./my-cp source.txt destination.txt
```
